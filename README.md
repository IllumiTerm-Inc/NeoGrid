## NeoGrid

A real-time digital rain visual inspired by classic cyberpunk terminals.
Katakana glyphs and numerals cascade across the screen, mutating constantly
as they fall, forming shifting columns of synthetic noise.

Designed to feel alive rather than random — subtle trails, fading depth,
and controlled density give the illusion of an active system stream rather
than static animation.

Best experienced fullscreen, in a dark room, with the hum of a machine
that’s doing something it probably shouldn’t be.
